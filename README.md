# Azuro betting

This repo showcases gasless betting on the [Azuro Protocol](https://azuro.org/) via Peaze. 

### What you'll need

1. Wallet with a bit of Polygon [USDT](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F) to bet with. 

### Setting up

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Peaze-Labs/azuro-demo.git
cd azuro-demo
npm i
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in your private key and Peaze API key in `.env`. 

### Running the demo

1. Obtaining betting data. 

	Visit the [Azuro GraphQL interface](https://thegraph.azuro.org/subgraphs/name/azuro-protocol/azuro-api-polygon-v3). 
 
 	In the top section of the query editor, paste this:

	```
	query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
	  games(
	    first: 2
	    where: $where
	    orderBy: turnover
	    orderDirection: desc
	    subgraphError: allow
	  ) {
	    gameId
	    slug
	    status
	    startsAt
	    conditions {
	      conditionId
	      isExpressForbidden
	      status
	      outcomes {
	        currentOdds
	        outcomeId
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}
	```
	
 	In the bottom section of the query editor, under `query variables`, paste this:
 	
 	```
 	{
	  	"where": {
			"hasActiveConditions": true,
			"liquidityPool": "0x7043e4e1c4045424858ecbced80989feafc11b36"
		}
	}
 	```
 	
 	This will return the next 2 upcoming games. The response should look something like this: 
 	
	```
	{
		"data": {
			"games": [
				"conditions": [
					{
						"conditionId": "100100000000000015811616850000000000000263423119",
						"isExpressForbidden": false,
						"status": "Created",
						"outcomes": [
							{
								"currentOdds": "1.835601489481",
								"outcomeId": "2361"
							},
							{
								"currentOdds": "1.765753218322",
								"outcomeId": "2362"
							}
						]
					}
				]
			]
		}
	}
	```
	
	For a single-bet, grab any `conditionId` and `outcomeId` pair. Paste these values as the `CONDITION_ID` and `OUTCOME_ID` constants at the top of the `singlebet.ts` file. 

	For a combo-bet, grab two `conditionId` and `outcomeId` pairs from _separate_ games. Paste these values as the `CONDITION_ID1`, `OUTCOME_ID1`, `CONDITION_ID2`, and `OUTCOME_ID2` constants at the top of the `combobet.ts` file. 

2. Use the following commands to place bets
	
	**single bet:**

	```sh
	npx ts-node single-bet.ts
	```

	**combo bet:**

	```sh
	npx ts-node combo-bet.ts
	```

3. Redeeming winning bets 

	In the `redeem-single-bet.ts` or `redeem-combo-bet.ts` files, paste in your bet ID as the `BET_ID` constant at the top. Then, use the following commands to redeem: 

	**single bet:**

	```sh
	npx ts-node redeem-single-bet.ts
	```

	**combo bet:**

	```sh
	npx ts-node redeem-combo-bet.ts
	```

### Troubleshooting

1. Bad GraphQL response

	In some instances, the GraphQL query will return data for games/conditions that are no longer valid. If you face persistent issues, try using a condition/outcome ID from a different game.
